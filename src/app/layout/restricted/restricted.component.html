      <p>At Max Evolve Financial Services Inc., we prioritize ethical business practices and compliance with regulatory standards. As such, there are certain industries that fall outside the scope of our services. We are unable to engage in business with the following industries:.</p>
       

        <h6>Adult Entertainment and Materials</h6>
        <p>
        Companies providing or producing adult content, including online and physical media, fall outside our scope due to regulatory and ethical considerations.</p>

       <h6> Firearm Vendors</h6>
       <p>
        Businesses involved in the sale or distribution of firearms or ammunition are restricted due to regulatory requirements and risk factors.</p>

        <h6>Government, Non-Profits, and Public Administration</h6>
        <p>
            We do not work with government entities, non-profit organizations, or public administration due to differing operational structures and compliance requirements.</p>

        <h6>Astrology, Divination, and Fortune-Telling Services</h6>
        <p>
            Businesses offering astrology, psychic readings, and related services are restricted as they do not align with our business consultancy’s scope and standards.</p>

    <h6>Lotteries, Casinos, Raffles, Gaming, and Gambling</h6>
    <p>  Gambling-related businesses, including lotteries and casinos, are excluded from our services due to high regulatory scrutiny and associated risk factors.    </p>

     <h6>  Money Services Business (MSB)</h6>
     <p>Entities involved in money transmission, currency exchange, or similar services are restricted due to stringent financial regulations and compliance requirements.</p>

      <h6> Religious and Civic Organizations</h6>
      <p>Religious institutions and civic organizations are not within our scope, as their operational needs typically differ from those of profit-driven businesses.</p>
   <h6>Rooming and Boarding Houses</h6>
   <p>
    We do not engage with businesses offering rooming or boarding services, including hostels and transient housing, due to operational and regulatory distinctions.</p>
